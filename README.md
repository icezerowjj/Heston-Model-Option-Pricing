# Monte-Carlo-Option-Pricing
This C++ project conducts Monte Carlo Simulation in option pricing based on multi-threading and  antithetic control variate to 
improve the efficiency of both running and estimating

In the main function results of ordinary Monte Carlo, multi-thread Monte Carlo and Antithetic Monte Carlo will be calculated. It shows that using
multi-threading is the fastest. 

And last we estimate the standard deviation to show that Antithetic Monte Carlo is the most efficient estimator.
